# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

## Before You Begin

- Welcome to your first opportunity as a front-end web designer. You will be advocating for your most important client—yourself! By making a portfolio, you'll take your first step toward building your web development brand.

- This will be one of your harder assignments, if only because you're just getting your feet wet in web design. Trust us, though; it will get easier. Invest your time in this assignment, and it will pay dividends!

## Directions

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

1. Create a new repository in GitHub called `Bootstrap-Portfolio`.

2. Clone this repository to your computer using the process we went over in class.

3. Navigate to the `Bootstrap-Portfolio` folder that you just cloned onto your machine. Inside this folder, create the following:

   - 3 HTML documents: `index.html`, `contact.html` and `portfolio.html`.
   - A folder called `assets`.
   - Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: `css` and `images`.
     - In the `css` folder, make a file called `style.css`.
     - In the `images` folder, save the images you plan on using (like your profile image and the placeholder images for the portfolio).

4. Push the above changes to GitHub.

   - Make sure to `git add .` and `git commit -m "initial site files"`. Then type `git push origin master` to push your changes to your GitHub repo.

5. Using Bootstrap, create a portfolio site with the following items:

- A navbar

- A responsive layout

- Responsive images

- The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

6. The design should look like the images in the `Assets` folder. You will notice that the site is slightly different for different display sizes. If you are using Bootstrap correctly, your site should be responsive and it should layout well in all display sizes.

7. When you create a website, it's standard practice to code your HTML files before writing any CSS and to write up one HTML file before moving onto the next. Write your HTML semantically, too:

   - If something is a heading, you use a heading tag.
   - If something is a list, you use an unordered or ordered list tag.
   - So on and so forth.

8. The content for the `index.html` should be unique to **you**.

   - Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
   - The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name is—that is fine and expected.
   - Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.

9. After all of your HTML is written, you can begin styling your pages using the `style.css` file you created.

   - Be sure to [validate your html](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
   - Consult the specs below these instructions for advice on styling your CSS files.

10. Push your changes to Github.

### Additional Specifcations

1. Colors _Pro-tip: Use the [Eye Dropper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka) Chrome extension to find the colors used on web pages._

   - Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): `#4aaaa5`
   - Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): `#777777`
   - Main header background color: `#ffffff`
   - Main header border color: `#cccccc`
   - Footer background color: `#666666`
   - Main content background color: `#ffffff`
   - Main content border color: `#dddddd`

2. Fonts:

   - For heading fonts use `font-family: 'Georgia', Times, Times New Roman, serif;`.
   - For all other fonts use `'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;`.

3. Profile Image Found on `index.html`:

   - Use a picture of yourself.
   - If you don't have a picture, you can grab a placeholder image from [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/). Save the images to your `images` folder.

4. Portfolio Images:

   - Placeholder images can be found at [LoremPixel](http://lorempixel.com/).
   - Save the images to your `images` folder.

5. Background Images:

   - The background pattern used was found on [Subtle Patterns](https://subtlepatterns.com/). You can browse through that site and find whichever pattern you like.

### Hints

- Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

- On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

### Minimum Requirements

- Functional, deployed application

- GitHub repository with README describing the project

### Bonus

- Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).

## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

- Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

- Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

- Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

- Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

- Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

- Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
