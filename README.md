#### Note
* I connected this portfolio to my current LinkedIn profile. I will whether update the current one or create a new profile closer to the end.
* I also would like to work more on website design, to implement new CSS frameworks
* I pinned projects, but some of them are incompleted. I'm still working on those to finalize them.
